# This file defines the codeowners of certain pieces of the code.
# These owners will automatically be requested as reviewers when
# a pull request is made that matches the filter.

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.

# Global Owners. Unless a later match takes precedence

# CODEOWNERS prevent renovate automerge since it will automatically ask for review
# See documentation for more details: https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/automerge/#codeowners
# NOTE: leave at the bottom for precedence matching
# May need to be updated as required
# Solution: make files used by renovate owned by everyone
