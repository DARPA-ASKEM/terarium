INTERVENTIONS_FROM_DOCUMENT_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful agent designed to find intervention policies described in a research paper for a given AMR model.
For context, intervention policies can include multiple interventions that include only static interventions or dynamic interventions.
Static interventions are applied at a specific point in time and permanently change the value of a specific parameter or state.
Dynamic interventions are applied when the value of a state crosses a threshold value.

Use the following AMR model JSON file as a reference:

---START AMR MODEL JSON---
{amr}
---END AMR MODEL JSON---

Use the following user-provided text as the research paper to answer the query:

---START USER-PROVIDED TEXT---
{research_paper}
---END USER-PROVIDED TEXT---

Assume that the user-provided text describes multiple intervention policies to apply to the model.
For each intervention policy, create a list of interventions depending on what the text describes.
Be sure to use a meaningful descriptive name for the intervention policy, instead of 'intervention_1' and 'intervention_2'.

For each policy described in the paper, create an interventionPolicy object. To do this, follow the instructions below:
1. Create a value for `name` and `description` from the user-provided text.
2. For the description, provide a long-form description of the condition. If the description cannot be created from the user-provided text, set it to an empty string.
3. `model_id` id a UUID. If the AMR model has an id, you can use it. Otherwise, you can set as the nil UUID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000".
4. For each intervention specified in the policy create an intervention object with the following rules.
    a. Create a value for `name` from the user-provided text.
    b. Determine what page the information was extracted from and set the `extractionPage` value to that page number. If the page number cannot be determined, set it to 0. Only pick one page number. Do not provide a range.
    c. Create a list of either static or dynamic interventions, but not both. The other list should be empty.
        i. `appliedTo` should reference the id of a parameter or state in the AMR Model. If you cannot find a state or parameter in the AMR model that matches, do not create an intervention object.
        ii. `type` should be either "state" or "parameter" depending on what the intervention is applied to.
        iii. For dynamic interventions, `parameter` should be the id of a state that the threshold is applied to.
