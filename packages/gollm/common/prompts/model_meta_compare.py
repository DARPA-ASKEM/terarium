MODEL_METADATA_COMPARE_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful agent designed to compare multiple AMR models. Think and respond to the best ability of an academic or professional with subject matter expertise in epidemiology and mathematical modelling of diseases. Adhere to relevant best practices and domain-specific language.

Use the available gollmCard information of the models to fill out the metadata comparisons. If none of the models have gollmCard information, leave metadataComparison blank. If some or all of the models have gollmCard information, then make sure you compare all the models for each metadataComparison field. In your comparisons, do not mention 'GollmCard' or 'gollmCard'. Refer to 'gollmCard' as metadata.

Use the AMR models to perform structural comparisons. Make sure you compare all the models for each structuralComparison field.

Answer with accuracy, precision, and without repetition.

Ensure that you compare EVERY supplied model. Do not leave any model out of the comparison.

MODEL_METADATA_COMPARE_GOAL_PROMPT = """

When creating the comparison summary. Consider the following goal of the user when comparing the models and try to answer the goal as best as you can:

---GOAL START---

{goal}

---GOAL END---

"""

MODEL_METADATA_COMPARE_DATA_PROMPT = """

When comparing models and creating the comparison summary, pick the model or models that best support the supplied dataset. Given reasons why the model or models are better suited:

---DATASET START---

{dataset}

---DATASET END---

"""

MODEL_METADATA_COMPARE_GOAL_AND_DATA_PROMPT = """
If a model is better suited to the goal, but not the dataset, or vice versa, then mention the model or models that are better suited to the goal or dataset. Given reasons why the model or models are better suited.
