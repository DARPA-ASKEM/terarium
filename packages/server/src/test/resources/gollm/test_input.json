Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic  requires implementation of multiple population-wide strate gies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing.  We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epi demic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model  considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected  (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T),  healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE.  Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected indi viduals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and  on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between  diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important  because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely  to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain  misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic  spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the  COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios  of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demon strate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to  be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to  end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \nAfter a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identi fied in Wuhan (Hubei), China1,2, an exponentially growing num ber of patients in mainland China were diagnosed with COVID-19,  prompting Chinese authorities to introduce radical measures to con tain the outbreak3. Despite these measures, a COVID-19 pandemic  ensued in the following months. The World Health Organisation  report dated 5 April 2020 reported 1,133,758 total cases and 62,784  deaths worldwide4. \nItaly has been severely affected5. After the first indigenous case  on 21 February 2020 in Lodi province, several suspect cases (initially  epidemiologically linked) began to emerge in the south and south west territory of Lombardy6. A \u2018red zone\u2019, encompassing 11 munici palities where SARS-CoV-2 infection was endemic, was instituted  on 22 February 2020, and put on lockdown to contain the emerging  threat. A campaign to identify and screen all close contacts with  confirmed cases of COVID-19 resulted in taking 691,461 nasal  swabs as of 5 April 2020. Of the 128,948 detected cases, 91,246 were  currently infected (28,949 hospitalized, 3,977 admitted to intensive  care units (ICUs) and 58,320 quarantined at home), 21,815 had been  \ndischarged due to recovery and 15,887 had died7. In the early days of  the epidemic in Italy, both symptomatic and asymptomatic people  underwent screening. A government regulation dated 26 February  2020 limited screening to symptomatic subjects only8. On 8 March  2020, to further contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the red zone  was extended to the entire area of Lombardy and 14 more northern  Italian provinces. On 9 March 2020, lockdown was declared for the  entire country9 and progressively stricter restrictions were adopted. \nCOVID-19 displays peculiar epidemiological traits when com pared with previous coronavirus outbreaks of SARS-CoV and  MERS-CoV. According to Chinese data10, a large number of trans missions, both in nosocomial and community settings, occurred  through human-to-human contact with individuals showing no or  mild symptoms. The estimated basic reproduction number (R0) for  SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 2.0 to 3.511\u201313, which seems comparable,  or possibly higher, than for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High viral  loads of SARS-CoV-2 were found in upper respiratory specimens of  patients showing little or no symptoms, with a viral shedding pat tern akin to that of influenza viruses14. Hence, inapparent transmis sion may play a major and underestimated role in sustaining the  outbreak. \nPredictive mathematical models for epidemics15\u201318 are fun damental to understand the course of the epidemic and to plan  effective control strategies. One commonly used model is the SIR  model19 for human-to-human transmission, which describes the  flow of individuals through three mutually exclusive stages of infec tion: susceptible, infected and recovered. More complex models can  accurately portray the dynamic spread of specific epidemics. For  the COVID-19 pandemic, several models have been developed. Lin  and colleagues extended a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious,  removed) model considering risk perception and the cumulative  number of cases20, Anastassopoulou and colleagues proposed a  discrete-time SIR model including dead individuals21, Casella devel oped a control-oriented SIR model that stresses the effects of delays  and compares the outcomes of different containment policies22 and  Wu and colleagues used transmission dynamics to estimate the clin ical severity of COVID-1923. Stochastic transmission models have  also been considered24,25. Here, we propose a new mean-field epide miological model for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy that extends  the classical SIR model, similar to that developed by Gumel and col leagues for SARS26. A summary of the main findings, limitations  and implications of the model for policymakers is shown in Table 1. \n1Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. 2Dipartimento di Scienze Matematiche, Informatiche e Fisiche, University of  Udine, Udine, Italy. 3Division of Infectious Diseases I, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. 4Department of Clinical, Surgical, Diagnostic,  and Paediatric Sciences, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. 5Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy. 6IEIIT-CNR, Milano, Italy. \u2709e-mail: giulia.giordano@unitn.it \nNature Medicine | VOL 26 | June 2020 | 855\u2013860 | www.nature.com/naturemedicine 855\nLetters NATuRE MEDICInE \nS \nContagion \nI D INFECTED DIAGNOSED \nAsymptomatic \nDiagnosis \nAsymptomatic \nSUSCEPTIBLE \n\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 \u03b5 \ninfected, \nundetected \n\u03b6 \ninfected, detected \n\u03b7 \n\u03bb \nH A Healing \nSymptoms Symptoms R \n\u03ba \nHEALED \n\u03c3 \u03be \u03c1 \nAILING \nSymptomatic infected, \nundetected \nDiagnosis \u03b8 \nCritical \nRECOGNIZED Symptomatic infected, \ndetected \nHealing \n\u00b5 \n\u03bd \nT \nCritical \nE \nEXTINCT \nDeath \u03c4 \nTHREATENED Acutely \nsymptomatic infected, \ndetected \nFig. 1 | The model.

We have proposed a new model that  predicts the evolution of epidemics and helps to assess the impact of different strategies to contain the spread of the infection,  including lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracing. \nMain findings and  limitations \nTesting is important because undetected infected people, most of whom are asymptomatic, largely sustain the epidemic spread.  Several possible scenarios have been outlined. Under the less stringent lockdown conditions with limited testing, we predict that  more than 70,000 people could die in Italy in the first year. However, if strict lockdown measures continue to be maintained and  population-wide testing and contact tracing efforts are substantially increased, the number of deaths could potentially be limited  \nto 25,000 people overall. As with all modeling studies, our predictions are based on reasonable assumptions, but the actual  course of the epidemic heavily relies on how and when isolation and safety measures are implemented. \nPolicy implications Our findings confirm that the adopted social-distancing measures are necessary and effective, and should be promptly enforced  at the earliest stage. Lockdown measures can only be relieved safely in the presence of widespread testing and contact tracing.  Combining lockdown and population-wide testing is key to rapidly ending the COVID-19 pandemic. \nOur model, named SIDARTHE, discriminates between detected  and undetected cases of infection and between different severity of  illness (SOI), non-life-threatening cases (asymptomatic and pauci symptomatic; minor and moderate infection) and potentially life threatening cases (major and extreme) that require ICU admission. \nThe total population is partitioned into eight stages of dis ease: S, susceptible (uninfected); I, infected (asymptomatic or  pauci-symptomatic infected, undetected); D, diagnosed (asymp tomatic infected, detected); A, ailing (symptomatic infected,  undetected); R, recognized (symptomatic infected, detected); T,  threatened (infected with life-threatening symptoms, detected);  H, healed (recovered); E, extinct (dead). The interactions among  these stages are shown in Fig. 1. We omit the probability rate of  becoming susceptible again after having recovered from the infec tion. Although anecdotal cases are found in the literature27, the rein fection rate value appears negligible. A detailed discussion of the  model considerations and parameters is provided in the Methods. \nFor the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, we estimate the model  parameters based on data from 20 February 2020 (day 1) to 5 April  2020 (day 46) and show how the progressive restrictions, includ ing the most recent lockdown progressively enforced since 9 March  2020, have affected the spread of the epidemic. We also model  possible longer-term scenarios illustrating the effects of different  countermeasures, including social distancing and population-wide  testing, to contain SARS-CoV-2. \nThe model parameters have been updated over time to reflect  the progressive introduction of increased restrictions. On day 1,  the basic reproduction number was R0=2.38, which resulted in a  substantial outbreak. On day 4, R0=1.66 as a result of the introduc tion of basic social distancing, awareness of the epidemic, hygiene  and behavioral recommendations, and early measures by the Italian  government (for example, closing schools). At day 12, asymptom atic individuals were almost no longer detected, and screening was  focused on symptomatic individuals (leading to R0=1.80).

The plots in b and d distinguish between the different  categories of infected patients: non-diagnosed asymptomatic (ND AS), diagnosed asymptomatic (D AS), non-diagnosed symptomatic (ND S), diagnosed  symptomatic (D S) and diagnosed with life-threatening symptoms (D IC). Note that a,c and b,d have different scales. \n22, a partially incomplete lockdown, of which the effectiveness was  reduced by the movement of people from the north to the south  of Italy when the country-wide lockdown was announced but not  yet enforced, yielded R0=1.60. When the national lockdown was  fully operational and strictly enforced, after day 28, R0=0.99, finally  reaching below 1. Moreover, R0=0.85 was achieved after day 38  due to a wider testing campaign that identified more mildly symp tomatic infected individuals. Figure 2a shows the model evolution  with the estimated parameters up to day 46; in the earliest epidemic  phase, the number of infected was considerably underestimated.  Of the total cases, 35% were undetected. In Fig. 2b, the infected  individuals are partitioned into the different subpopulations (diag \nnosed or not, with different SOI classification). Over a 350-day  horizon, in the absence of further policy changes, Fig. 2c predicts  that 0.61% of the population will contract the virus (and 0.45% will  be diagnosed), while 0.06% of the population will die from COVID \n19. The peak of the number of concurrently infected individu als will occur on around day 50 at 0.19% of the population, while  the peak of concurrently diagnosed infected individuals will occur  later (around day 56) and amounts to 0.17% of the population. The  actual case fatality rate (CFR) is 9.8% and the perceived CFR is 13%.  Figure 2d shows that each infected subpopulation reaches its peak  at a different time. \nExtended Data Fig. 1 shows how the situation could have evolved  if milder or stronger measures had been implemented earlier. The  curve following day 22 shows the importance and effectiveness of  a prompt lockdown. The actual epidemic evolution corresponds to  an intermediate scenario: the lockdown measures had a moderate  effect, probably due to their incremental nature. \nWe predict a range of possible future scenarios, with different  measures enforced after day 50. \nFigure 3a,b shows, if the lockdown is weakened, a sudden and  strong increase of the spread of disease, a prolonged emergency  and more deaths (0.12% of the population in the first 350 days).  Figure 3c,d shows the benefits of stricter lockdown measures: after  350 days, 0.41% of the population would contract the virus (0.30%  diagnosed) and 0.04% of the population would die. \nA policy of population-wide testing and contact tracing would  help to rapidly end the epidemic, as suggested by Peto28. Figure  4a,b shows the effect of such measures: the peak would be reached  sooner and, after 350 days, 0.43% of the population would con \ntract the virus (0.33% diagnosed), with an estimated 0.05% dying.  Figure 4c,d shows the effect of combining a milder lockdown with  widespread testing and contact tracing: after 350 days, 0.52% of the  population would contract the virus (0.41% diagnosed) and 0.05%  would die. \nNature Medicine | VOL 26 | June 2020 | 855\u2013860 | www.nature.com/naturemedicine 857\nLetters NATuRE MEDICInE a b \n) \nn\no\nit\na\nlu\npo\np \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\nit\nc\na\nr\nf\n( \ns\ne\ns\na\nC\n0.015 0.010 0.005 \nPredicted epidemic evolution: actual vs diagnosed cases of infection \n\n\n1.0 \n) \nn\no\ni\nt\n0.8 \na\nl\nu\np\no\np\n \ne\n0.6 \nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\n0.4 \ni\nt\nc\na\nr\nf\n(\n \ns\n0.2 \ne\ns\na\nC\n\u00d710\u20133 \nPredicted evolution of infected subpopulations \nInfected ND AS \nInfected D AS\n\n\n050 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time (days) \nc d Predicted epidemic evolution: actual vs diagnosed cases \n050 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time (days) \nPredicted evolution of infected subpopulations \n) n\no\nit\na\nlu\npo\np \ne\nht\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\nit\nc\na\nr\nf\n( \ns\ne\ns\na\nC\n0.015 0.010 0.005 \nof infection \n\n\n1.0 \n) \nn\no\ni\nt\n0.8 \na\nl\nu\np\no\np\n \ne\n0.6 \nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\n0.4 \ni\nt\nc\na\nr\nf\n(\n \ns\n0.2 \ne\ns\na\nC\n\u00d710\u20133 \nInfected ND AS \nInfected D AS\n\n\n050 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time (days) \n050 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time (days) \nFig. 3 | The effect of lockdown. a\u2013d, Epidemic evolution predicted by the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy when, after day 50, the social  distancing countermeasures are weakened, leading to a larger R0=\u20090.98 (a,b), or strengthened, leading to a smaller R0=\u20090.50 (c,d). a,c, The difference  between the actual (real cases) and perceived (diagnosed cases) evolution of the epidemics.

Note that a,c and b,d have different scales. \nHence, the current adopted lockdown measures are vital to con tain the epidemic and cannot be relieved. Rather, they should be  even more restrictive. The enforced lockdown could be mitigated  in the presence of widespread testing and contact tracing, which  would strongly contribute to a rapid resolution of the epidemic. \nDistinguishing between diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases  highlights a distortion in disease statistics. The discrepancy between  the actual CFR (total number of deaths due to the infection, divided  by the total number of infected people) and the perceived CFR  (number of deaths ascribed to the infection, divided by the number  of people diagnosed as infected) can be quantified, which explains  the gap between the actual infection dynamics and perception of  the outbreak. Performing an insufficient number of tests underesti mates the transmission rate and overestimates the CFR. Our model  can predict the long-term effects of underdiagnosis. \nConcerning diagnostic tests for COVID-19, currently, standard  molecular methods to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respi ratory samples are based on non-specific real-time polymerase  chain reaction with reverse transcription methods, which target  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and E genes29. These tests are  time-consuming and cannot be done on all susceptible individuals  in the population; high false negatives rates have been reported and  certified laboratories with expensive equipment are needed. Rapid  tests with high sensitivity and specificity that can be easily adapted  to real-life settings (schools, airports, train stations) are urgently  \nrequired. Some laboratories are moving in this direction, develop ing a 15min test to detect SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins IgM and  IgG simultaneously in human blood30. \nOur model confirms that diagnosis campaigns can reduce the  infection peak (the diagnosed population enters quarantine and is  therefore less likely to affect the susceptible population) and help  end the epidemic more quickly28. Healthcare workers are more  likely to be exposed and their risk of infection is increased, as sup \nported by reports from China31,32 suggesting that disease amplifica tion in healthcare settings will occur despite restrictive measures. The model does not consider reduced availability of medical  care due to the healthcare system reaching or even surpassing its  capacity33. These analyses can only be done indirectly. For example,  when the number of seriously affected individuals is high (above  a threshold), the mortality coefficient will be increased due to an  insufficient number of ICUs. \nWe compare scenarios with control measures of varying strength  and nature, predicting for each the timing and magnitude of the  epidemic peak, including the peak of ICU admissions. According  to our findings, a partial implementation of lockdown measures  results in a delay in the peak of infected individuals and patients  admitted to the ICU, contrasting with an only moderate decrease  in the total number of infected individuals and ICU admissions.  Conversely, the implementation of very strong social-distancing  strategies would result in an anticipated lower peak of infected  \nNature Medicine | VOL 26 | June 2020 | 855\u2013860 | www.nature.com/naturemedicine 858\nNATuRE MEDICInE Letters \na b \nPredicted epidemic evolution: actual vs diagnosed cases \nof infection \nPredicted evolution of infected subpopulations \u00d710\u20133 \n) n\no\nit\na\nlu\npo\np \ne\nht\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\nit\nc\na\nr\nf\n( \ns\ne\ns\na\nC\n0.015 0.010 0.005 \n\n\n1.0 \n) \nn\no\ni\nt\n0.8 \na\nl\nu\np\no\np\n \ne\n0.6 \nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\n0.4 \ni\nt\nc\na\nr\nf\n(\n \ns\n0.2 \ne\ns\na\nC\nInfected ND AS \nInfected D AS\n\n\n0 \n50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time (days) \n050 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time (days) \nc d Predicted epidemic evolution: actual vs diagnosed cases \nPredicted evolution of infected subpopulations \n) n\no\nit\na\nlu\npo\np \ne\nht\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\nit\nc\na\nr\nf\n( \ns\ne\ns\na\nC\n0.015 0.010 0.005 \nof infection \n\n\n1.0 \n) \nn\no\ni\nt\n0.8 \na\nl\nu\np\no\np\n \ne\n0.6 \nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\n0.4 \ni\nt\nc\na\nr\nf\n(\n \ns\n0.2 \ne\ns\na\nC\n\u00d710\u20133 \nInfected ND AS \nInfected D AS\n\n\n0 \n50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time (days) \n050 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time (days) \nFig. 4 | The effect of testing. a\u2013d, Epidemic evolution predicted by the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy when, after day 50, massive testing and  contact tracing is enforced (a,b), leading to R0=\u20090.59, as well as in parallel with weakening social-distancing measures (c,d), leading to R0=\u20090.77.

Our simulation  results, achieved by combining the model with the available data  about the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, suggest that enforcing  strong social-distancing measures is urgent, necessary and effec \ntive, in line with other reports in the literature2,22,24. The earlier the  lockdown is enforced, the stronger the effect obtained. The model  results also confirm the benefits of mass testing, whenever facilities  are available28. We believe these indications can be useful to manage  the epidemic in Italy, as well as in countries that are still in the early  stages of outbreak. \nAlthough the mortality rate (number of deaths in the whole pop ulation) of COVID-19 can be decreased with restrictive measures  that reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the CFR (number of deaths  in the infected population) is essentially constant in different scenar ios, unaffected by the extent of social restriction and testing. Despite  rigid isolation policies, COVID-19 patients may still be burdened  with excess case fatality, and efforts should be focused on developing  more effective treatment strategies to combat COVID-19. As new  drugs and vaccines are being tested and evaluated, the current sce nario will evolve to account for these ongoing innovations34\u201337. \nOnline content \nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting  summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary informa tion, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author  contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and  code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591- 020-0883-7. \nReceived: 21 March 2020; Accepted: 14 April 2020;  Published online: 22 April 2020 \nReferences \n1.

The interactions among different stages of infection  are visually represented in the graphical scheme in Fig. 1. The parameters are  defined as follows: \n\u2022  \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 respectively denote the transmission rate (the probability of  disease transmission in a single contact multiplied by the average number  of contacts per person) due to contacts between a susceptible subject and an  infected, a diagnosed, an ailing or a recognized subject. Typically, \u03b1 is larger  than \u03b3 (assuming that people tend to avoid contacts with subjects showing  symptoms, even though diagnosis has not been made yet), which in turn is  larger than \u03b2 and \u03b4 (assuming that subjects who have been diagnosed are  properly isolated). Tese parameters can be modifed by social-distancing  policies (for example, closing schools, remote working, lockdown). Te risk  of contagion due to threatened subjects, treated in proper ICUs, is assumed  negligible. \n\u2022  \u03b5 and \u03b8 capture the probability rate of detection, relative to asymptomatic and  symptomatic cases, respectively. Tese parameters, also modifable, refect  the level of attention on the disease and the number of tests performed over  the population: they can be increased by enforcing a massive contact tracing  and testing campaign28. Note that \u03b8 is typically larger than \u03b5, as a symptomatic  individual is more likely to be tested. \n\u2022  \u03b6 and \u03b7 denote the probability rate at which an infected subject, respectively  not aware and aware of being infected, develops clinically relevant symptoms,  and are comparable in the absence of specifc treatment. Tese parameters are  disease-dependent, but may be partially reduced by improved therapies and  acquisition of immunity against the virus. \n\u2022  \u00b5 and \u03bd respectively denote the rate at which undetected and detected infected  subjects develop life-threatening symptoms; they are comparable if there is  no known specifc treatment that is efective against the disease, otherwise \u00b5 may be larger. Conversely, \u03bd may be larger because infected individuals with  more acute symptoms, who have a higher risk of worsening, are more likely to  have been diagnosed. Tese parameters can be reduced by means of improved  therapies and acquisition of immunity against the virus. \n\u2022  \u03c4 denotes the mortality rate (for infected subjects with life-threatening symp toms) and can be reduced by means of improved therapies. \n\u2022  \u03bb, \u03ba, \u03be, \u03c1 and \u03c3 denote the rate of recovery for the fve classes of infected sub jects; they may difer signifcantly if an appropriate treatment for the disease  is known and adopted for diagnosed patients, but are probably comparable  otherwise. Tese parameters can be increased thanks to improved treatments  and acquisition of immunity against the virus. \nonly in animals41,42, while the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum via  primary infection or passive transfer has been shown to prevent respiratory tract  replication of SARS-CoV in a murine model43. From a modeling perspective, we  are particularly interested in predictions over a relatively short horizon within  which the temporary immunity is likely still to be in place, and the possibility of  reinfection would negligibly affect the total number of susceptible individuals and  so there would be no substantial difference in the evolution of the epidemic curves  we consider. To provide solid support to this claim, Extended Data Fig. 2 shows  the results of numerical simulation of the model when the possibility of reinfection  is introduced: the evolution is almost identical, with the only difference being  that the recovered population of course decreases over time. Hence, based on the  evidence at hand, although we cannot rule out that adaptive immunity against  SARS-CoV-2 may not provide long-lasting protection, we may reasonably consider  the probability of reinfection to be negligible within the scope of our model. \nAlso, our model accounts for a distinction between non-diagnosed individuals,  who spread the infection more because they are not in isolation, and diagnosed  individuals, who transmit the disease much less thanks to proper isolation and  complying with strict rules, either in hospital or at home. Because Italy is on  lockdown, extended emergency measures nationwide are being applied to contain  the epidemic: unless indispensable for fundamental activities, people are forced  to stay at home in family settings, drastically reducing the risk of spreading the  disease. Person-to-person household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been  described in China44,45. Although the infection of household members of COVID 19-positive individuals is possible, the rate of this occurrence is difficult to  estimate so far. The only way to completely avoid such risk is to separate infected  individuals in dedicated quarantine centers46, as has been done partially in Italy,  confining infected people in individual hotel rooms. Even with reduced admissions  to hospital, patients that are treated at home and assisted by household members  strictly comply with the home isolation guidelines issued by experts47, ranging  from sanitary hygiene measures (including waste management, cleaning of  contaminated surfaces and household laundering) to interhuman contact measures  among family members (the caregiver of a suspected or confirmed COVID 19-infected individual in home isolation must be in good health and maintain  a distance of at least 1m, avoiding direct contact with oral or respiratory  secretions, faeces and urine; moreover, a surgical mask and disposable gloves  should always be used). Hence, we can safely assume that in-house transmission  is severely limited. \nAlthough we do consider a delay in the emergence of symptoms, through  asymptomatic (or pauci-symptomatic) patients, categorized as undetected  (infected) and detected (diagnosed), our model does not account for a possible  latency between exposure to the virus and onset of infectiousness, because there  is mounting evidence that an infected individual can transmit the virus at an  early, preclinical stage of the disease, based on epidemiological investigation  of COVID-19 clusters45,48\u201350. Moreover, recent studies estimated median serial  interval values for COVID-19 to be close to or shorter than the median incubation  period51,52, further proving the possibility of presymptomatic transmission of the  disease. For this reason, we deemed it unnecessary to include an additional stage:  although asymptomatic, individuals exposed to the virus retain a potential of viral  transmission and thus reasonably fit within the infected and diagnosed stages. \nFinally, the SIDARTHE model is a mean-field type of model, where the  average effect of phenomena involving the whole population is captured. Social  mixing patterns are incorporated into our contagion parameters in an averaged  \nfashion over the whole population, irrespective of age. However, our model is fully  flexible and suited to include, for example, a distinction between age classes, which  would require splitting each variable of the model into N variables if N age classes  are considered. Another possible future development is to extend the model to  predict the simultaneous evolution of other diseases, which, due to the epidemic  emergency, may be overestimated, underestimated or not treated appropriately  because the healthcare system is overloaded, thus leading to an increased number  of \u2018collateral\u2019 deaths not directly linked to the virus. \nAnalysis of the mathematical model. The SIDARTHE model (1)\u2013(8) is a bilinear  system with eight differential equations. The system is positive: all the state  variables take non-negative values for t\u22650 if initialized at time 0 with non-negative  values. Note that H(t) and E(t) are cumulative variables that depend only on the  other ones and their own initial conditions. \nThe system is compartmental and demonstrates the  \nmass conservation property: as can be immediately checked,  \nDiscussion on modeling choices.

Given the scarcity  of available data, it is impossible to have conclusive evidence about immunity at  this stage. Immunity might also be temporary38. Although some reports suggest the  possibility of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection27,39,40, the indicated presence of viral RNA  in respiratory samples might reflect a persistence rather than a true recurrence.  The literature on the recrudescence of related members of the coronavirus  family, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, is similarly sporadic.

The IDART subsystem with susceptible population  S is asymptotically  stable if and only if \n S< S* \u00bc r1r2r3r4 \nrepresents the fraction of population that has never been infected. This value  is a decreasing function of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4, which are the infection  parameters.

Perhaps more importantly, it can also be explained by the Italian  criteria for (provisional) statistics, which lead to overestimation. In fact, unlike  other countries, the official numbers for COVID-19 deaths provisionally include  the deaths of all people tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even when they  had multiple pre-existing life-threatening diseases and the exact cause of death  had not yet been ascertained, so these numbers still need to be confirmed55. Thus,  an important challenge in tuning the model is that the initial data are affected by  statistical distortion: in particular, the values of the ratio death/infected are highly  \n0 \nIf we consider an initial condition in which only undiagnosed infected I(0)>0  I \noverestimated.

So, if there is a change in the parameters at time t0, for example due  to imposed restrictions and countermeasures, the prediction has to be adjusted  by considering f0=\u2212c\u22a4F\u22121x(t0), where F includes the new parameter values and  x(t0)=(I(t0)D(t0)A(t0)R(t0)T(t0))\u22a4. Clearly equation (20) also has to be updated by  considering the new S(t0). \nAn important indicator of the dynamics of an epidemiologic model is the CFR,  which is the ratio between the number of deaths and the number of infected.

The model involves many state variables, as  well as a large number of uncertain parameters whose numerical determination  is a very challenging problem; it is likely that an infinite number of different  parameter sets could be found, matching the data equally well. On the other  hand, our parameters are control tuning knobs whose values should realistically  reproduce the data and the reproduction number R0 in plausible scenarios. Relying  on a\u00a0priori epidemiological and clinical information about the relative parameter  magnitude (as discussed above), and starting from a random initial guess, the  model parameters have been fitted by reiterated local minimization of the sum of  the squares of the errors. During the course of the simulation, the parameters have  been updated based on the successive measures, of increasing strength, adopted by  policymakers. \nIn particular, the fraction of the population in each stage at day 1 is set  as: I=200/60e6, D=20/60e6, A=1/60e6, R=2/60e6, T=0, H=0, E=0;  S=1\u2013I\u2013D\u2013A\u2013R\u2013T\u2013H\u2013E. The parameters are set as \u03b1=0.570, \u03b2=\u03b4=0.011,  \u03b3=0.456, \u03b5=0.171, \u03b8=0.371, \u03b6=\u03b7=0.125, \u03bc=0.017, \u03bd=0.027, \u03c4=0.01,  \u03bb=\u03c1=0.034 and \u03ba=\u03be=\u03c3=0.017.

Hence, the new basic reproduction number becomes R0=1.60. After day 28, the lockdown is fully operational and gets stricter (working is  no longer a good reason for going out: gradually, non-indispensable activities are  stopped): we get \u03b1=0.210 and \u03b3=0.110, hence R0=0.99. \nAfter day 38, a wider testing campaign is launched: this yields \u03b5=0.200, and  also \u03c1=\u03ba=\u03be=0.020, while \u03c3=0.010 and \u03b6=\u03b7=0.025. Therefore, R0=0.85. The parameters above were used to simulate the model and generate the  graphs reported in Fig. 2.

The current number of infected (including all stages), the number of recovered  and the cumulative number of diagnosed cases are well reproduced, but a small  \nFit of the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. We infer the model  parameters based on the official data (source: Protezione Civile and Ministero  della Salute) about the evolution of the epidemic in Italy from 20 February 2020  (day 1) through 5 April 2020 (day 46). The official data we gathered are provided  in Supplementary Table 1. We turn the data into fractions over the whole Italian  population (~60 million). \nThe estimated parameter values are based on the data about the number  of currently infected individuals with different SOI (asymptomatic or  pauci-symptomatic, quarantined at home, roughly corresponding to variable  D(t) in our model; symptomatic and hospitalized, roughly corresponding to  variable R(t) in our model; symptomatic in life-threatening conditions, admitted  to ICUs, roughly corresponding to variable T(t) in our model) and the number  \nNature Medicine | www.nature.com/naturemedicine\nmismatch can be noted in the last days when distinguishing between different  SOI. This discrepancy can have two interpretations: on the one hand, the model  considers infected with different severities (for example, T(t) is the number of  life-threatened patients that would need ICU admission) while the data report the  actual treatment that the patients received (for example, the number of patients  actually admitted to ICUs, which is constrained by the number of available beds  and can be limited if the infected suddenly and quickly worsen, leading to death,  before admission to the hospital). Hence, our overestimation of ICU patients may  be due to saturation of the healthcare system, which is neglected in the model, or to  the sudden worsening of infected who die at home before having the time to reach  the ICU. Another possible explanation for our overestimation of patients with  symptoms, and life-threatening symptoms, and our underestimation of patients  \nLetters NATuRE MEDICInE \nthat are asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic, is that the average age of infected  people is getting lower and lower, and younger patients are less likely to show  serious or life-threatening symptoms. \nIn the possible future scenarios reported in Figs. 3 and 4, the parameters are  changed after day 50 as follows. In Fig. 3a,b, \u03b1=0.252, hence R0=0.98 (increased).  In Fig. 3c,d, \u03b1=0.105, hence R0=0.50 (significantly decreased). In Fig. 4a,b,  \u03b5=0.400, hence R0=0.59 (decreased, although not as much as in the previous  scenario). In Fig. 4c,d, \u03b1=0.420 but also \u03b5=0.600, therefore R0=0.77 (reduced,  although not as much as in the previous two scenarios). \nConversely, Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the epidemic evolution that would  have been predicted by the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy if, after  day 22, social-distancing countermeasures had been absent (Extended Data  Fig. 1a,b), mild (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), strong (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f) and  very strong (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). In all cases, the actual CFR is ~7.2%, while  the perceived CFR is ~9.0%. \nExtended Data Fig. 1a,b shows that, in the absence of further countermeasures  after day 22 (just closing schools and hygiene recommendations), we have  \u03b1=0.422, \u03b3=0.285 and \u03b2=\u03b4=0.0057, hence R0=1.66 and the model predicts an  evolution that leads to 73% of the population having contracted the virus (and  ~64% having been diagnosed) and ~5.2% of the population having died because  of the contagion over a 300-day horizon (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The peak of the  number of concurrently infected individuals occurs at around 76 days and amounts  to ~44% of the population; however, the peak of concurrently diagnosed infected  individuals occurs later, around 82 days, and amounts to 39% of the population.  Extended Data Fig. 1b shows how the different subpopulations of infected  individuals evolve over time, and it is interesting to notice that each subpopulation  reaches its peak at a different time. In particular, the fraction of infected who need  intensive care reaches its peak, almost 16.5% of the population, after 107 days. \nExtended Data Fig. 1c,d shows that, with social-distancing countermeasures  after day 22 having a mild effect, \u03b1=0.285 and \u03b3=0.171, hence R0=1.13, still larger  than 1. Hence, the peak is delayed (and reduced in amplitude), because the increase  \nin the number of new infected is reduced. Over a 500-day horizon, as shown in  Extended Data Fig. 1c, the model predicts an evolution that leads to a peak in  the number of concurrently infected individuals around day 170, amounting  to 11.7% of the population (10.6% of the population have been diagnosed).  Eventually, 35% of the population have contracted the virus (and ~30% have been  diagnosed) and ~2.5% of the population have died because of the contagion. The  fraction of patients in need of intensive care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1d,  reaches its peak on day 198, amounting to 5.3% of the population. The adopted  social-distancing policy, although mild, has some impact and helps gain more time  to strengthen and supply the healthcare system, but is still insufficient. \nExtended Data Fig. 1e,f shows that, with stronger social-distancing  countermeasures, able to yield \u03b1=0.200 and \u03b3=0.086, hence R0=0.787, now lower  than 1, the peak is not delayed, but anticipated, because the increase in the number  of new infected is reduced so much that it soon becomes a decrease. Over a 300-day  horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e, the model predicts an evolution of the  situation that leads to a peak in the number of concurrently infected individuals  around day 50, amounting to 0.092% of the population; the peak in diagnosed  infected occurs at day 54 and amounts to 0.083% of the population. Eventually,  0.25% of the population have contracted the virus (and ~0.22% have been  diagnosed) and ~0.02% of the population have died because of the contagion. The  fraction of patients in need of intensive care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1f,  reaches its peak on day 85, amounting to 0.04% of the population. \nExtended Data Fig. 1g,h shows that, with even stronger social-distancing  countermeasures, \u03b1=\u03b3=0.057, hence R0=0.0329, significantly lower than 1. Over  a 300-day horizon, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1g, the model predicts an  evolution of the situation that leads to a peak in the number of concurrently infected  individuals around day 25, amounting to 0.057% of the population; the peak in  diagnosed infected occurs at day 35 and amounts to 0.048% of the population.  Eventually, 0.086% of the population have contracted the virus (and ~0.074% have  been diagnosed) and ~0.006% of the population have died because of the contagion.  The fraction of patients in need of intensive care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1h,  reaches its peak on day 64, amounting to 0.02% of the population. \nThese scenarios, although surpassed, are fundamental to prove that lockdown  was an appropriate policy, given that, in the absence of social-distancing  countermeasures, the epidemic could have had tragic outcomes; also, they  suggest\u2014for countries early on in the outbreak evolution\u2014that strictly enforcing  the lockdown as early as possible leads to enormous benefits with respect to a  delayed intervention. \nModel sensitivity analysis. We now investigate the sensitivity of the model  to parameter variations, focusing in particular on the parameters that can be  influenced by policymakers: transmission parameters, related to lockdown  measures (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4), and testing parameters, related to testing and contact  tracing policies (\u03b5, \u03b8). To illustrate the effect of changing the parameter values in  the model, our sensitivity analysis results are reported in Extended Data Figs. 4\u201310. \nInterestingly, the model is particularly sensitive to variations in the value of \u03b1 and of \u03b5. Increasing \u03b1 significantly increases all the curves (Extended Data Fig. 4).  Also increasing the other transmission parameters, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4, increases all the  \ncurves\u2014that is, increases the values of all the variables, point by point, over time  (Extended Data Figs. 5\u20137), although the sensitivity is smaller. All these parameters  can be decreased by policymakers, by enforcing lockdown and social-distancing  measures, and stringent safety procedures in hospitals and for home assistance of  diagnosed infected. \nConversely, increasing \u03b5 significantly decreases all the curves (Extended Data  Fig. 8). Also increasing the other testing parameter \u03b8 decreases all the curves\u2014that  is, decreases the values of all the variables, point by point, over time (Extended  Data Fig. 9), but the sensitivity is smaller. These two parameters can be increased  by policymakers by enforcing population-wide testing and contact tracing,  focused on discovering, respectively, asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.  Discovering infected people at an earlier stage appears to help reduce the  contagion more. \nThe other parameters are harder to control with prevention and mitigation  strategies (Extended Data Fig. 10). Increasing \u03b6 and \u03b7 decreases the final number  of infected and recovered, but also increases the number of deaths; the number  of symptomatic and life-threatening infections initially increases, to decrease  afterwards. Increasing \u03bc and \u03bd decreases the final number of infected and  recovered, but also increases the number of deaths; the number of life-threatening  infections initially increases, to decrease afterwards. Increasing \u03bb, as well as the  other healing parameters \u03c1, \u03ba, \u03be and \u03c3, decreases all the curves, apart from the  curve of recovered patients, which initially increases (due to a higher recovery rate)  and then eventually decreases (due to fewer infections overall). Increasing \u03c4 leaves  all the curves almost unaffected, apart from the curve of life-threatened infected,  which is decreased, also leading to a small decrease in the curve of all infected  cases, a decrease in the curve of recovered and an increase in the curve of deaths. \nDiscussion of the model features. The key feature of our proposed model is  the distinction between detected and undetected infection cases, and between  cases with different SOI classifications (mild and moderate versus major and  extreme). Distinguishing between diagnosed and not diagnosed cases allows us  to highlight the perceived distortion in disease statistics, such as the number of  infected individuals, the transmission rate and the CFR (the ratio between the  number of deaths ascribed to the infection and the number of diagnosed cases).  The discrepancy between the actual CFR (total number of deaths due to the  infection, divided by the total number of people who have been infected) and the  perceived CFR (number of deaths ascribed to the infection, divided by the number  of people who have been diagnosed as infected) can be quantified based on this  model. Therefore, the model can explain the possible discrepancy between the  actual infection dynamics and the perception of the phenomenon. Misperception  (either resulting in underestimating or overestimating) can be particularly relevant  in the early phases of an epidemic phenomenon due to the lack of thorough  information: for example, performing an insufficient number of tests may lead  to underestimating the transmission rate (because many infected subjects are not  diagnosed as such) and overestimating the CFR (because critical or fatal cases  hardly go undetected). The model thus provides a rough quantification of the  error in estimating the actual number of infected people due to the lack of proper  diagnostic tests, or due to insufficient number of diagnostic tests being performed.  Also, it can explain and predict the long-term effects of underdiagnosis, including  the (apparently surprising) increased number of infections and fatalities, with  sudden outbreaks after long silent periods. \nOnce the model parameters have been estimated on the basis of the available  clinical data, the model enables us to reproduce and predict the dynamic evolution  of the epidemic and to evaluate the possible underestimation or overestimation of  the epidemic phenomenon based on current statistics, which are heavily subject  to bias (for example, asymptomatic patients may get tested according to some  protocols, not tested according to others). \nThe model helps evaluate and predict the effect of the implementation of  different guidelines and protocols (for example, more extensive screening for the  disease or stricter social-distancing measures), which typically results in a change  in the model parameters. \nThe model predictions in the long run are not very sensitive to the initial  conditions, but they are sensitive to the parameter values (and in particular  extremely sensitive to some of these, as our sensitivity analysis has indicated),  which are deeply uncertain and can vary due to several factors, such as population  density, cultural habits, environmental conditions and age distribution of the  population. The predictions must also consider parameter variations due to the  measures imposed by the government. This is a fundamental aspect: in the long  term, not imposing drastic measures leads to catastrophic outcomes, even when  the initially affected population is a small fraction. \nSocial-distancing measures are modeled by reducing the infection coefficients  \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4. The infection peak time is not monotonic with increasing restrictions.  Partial restrictions on population movements postpone the peak, while strong  restrictions anticipate the peak. Mild containment measures may have negative  effects, for example augmenting the fraction of the population with life-threatening  symptoms with respect to the fraction of population with mild symptoms. \nDiagnosis campaigns can reduce the infection peak, because the diagnosed  population enters quarantine and hence is less likely to affect the susceptible  population. \nNature Medicine | www.nature.com/naturemedicine\nNATuRE MEDICInE Letters \nReporting Summary.

Epidemic evolution that would have been predicted by the model for the COVID-19  outbreak in Italy if, after day 22, social-distancing countermeasures had been: absent (panels a and b), mild (panels c and d), strong (panels e and f)  and very strong (panels g and h). In all cases, the actual Case Fatality Rate is around 7.2%, while the perceived CFR is around 9.0%. Panels (a), (c), (e),  (g) show the difference between the actual (real cases) and the perceived (diagnosed cases) evolution of the epidemics, while panels (b), (d), (f), (h)  distinguish between the different categories of infected patients. Note the different scales between the panels, having different orders of magnitude, which  testify the enormous impact of social-distancing and lockdown. \nLetters NATuRE MEDICInE Extended Data Fig. 2 | See next page for caption. \nNature Medicine | www.nature.com/naturemedicine\nNATuRE MEDICInE Letters \nExtended Data Fig. 2 | Sensitivity analysis with respect to loss of immunity.
