## Compare Models
Please go through __every__ step of the test scenario.\
Report any issues into GitHub: [open an issue](https://github.com/DARPA-ASKEM/terarium/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+Q%26A&template=qa-issue.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%3A+).

### 1. Begin test
1. Login to https://app.staging.terarium.ai using the test account
    ```
    email: qa@test.io
    password: askem-quality-assurance
    ```
2. Create, or open, project named `QA [Your Name]`

### 2. Upload assets
1. Add [Bertozzi2020 Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PcqIf75e9llNshCDZDt3L6mIdhUmLMvE/view?usp=sharing) to your project
2. Add [Fang2020 Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YPyRKA3pmjNpVH5egpds4Vm3RnVyP2LI/view?usp=sharing) to your project
3. Add [Tang2020 Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1njXxZ9ZoMqnZqobW4eVDVVfKvyLbfLRh/view?usp=sharing) to your project
4. Add [Bertozzi2020 Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_YL1861KSkq08aEUOoh8Z2MknfLd4cmc/view?usp=sharing) to your project
5. Add [Fang2020 Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13YXIS58MSGfMJzgTid3MaX0vwwgmV2X7/view?usp=sharing) to your project
6. Add [Tang2020 Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Terd--gDArLMqCaG5Cn-_2-6do145tWv/view?usp=sharing) to your project
7. Wait for extractions to finish for uploaded document

### 3. Compare models without model cards
1. Create a new workflow
2. Add the Bertozzi2020, Fang2020, and Tang2020 models to the workflow
3. Create a new "Compare models" operator
4. Attach the Bertozzi2020, Fang2020, and Tang2020 models to the "Compare models" operator
5. Open the compare models drilldown
6. Ensure that when the drill-down starts:
   - The model graphs are displayed
   - There is a "Concept context comparison" section
   - There is a "Tabular context comparison" section
   - There is a "Concept graph comparison" section
7. Click on the "Compare" button. When the overview is generated, it should compare the structure of the AMR models.
   - It should have a title that states it is comparing all 3 models
   - It should have a summary of the comparison
   - It should have detailed comparisons of the structure of the models
   - It should have vague comparisons of the metadata of the models
8. Add a goal of comparison such as "which model is best to simulate covid spread in Canada" and click on the compare button
   - The summary should now address the goal and make a recommendation

### 4. Compare models with partial model cards
1. Enrich the Bertozzi2020 and Fang2020 models with their respective documents 
2. Re-open the "Compare models" operator
3. Open the drilldown
4. Ensure that when the drill-down starts:
   - The summary regenerates automatically
   - The model graphs are displayed
   - Model card information is displayed for Bertozzi2020 and Fang2020
   - There is a "Concept context comparison" section
   - There is a "Tabular context comparison" section
   - There is a "Concept graph comparison" section
6. Clear the goal and click on the "Compare" button. When the overview is generated, it should compare both the structure of the AMR models and the metadata information.
   - It should have a title that states it is comparing all 3 models
   - It should have a summary of the comparison
   - It should compare the structure of ALL the models
   - It should compare the metadata information for Bertozzi2020 and Fang2020 only
7. Add a goal of comparison and click on the compare button
   - The summary should address the goal and make a recommendation


### 5. Compare models all with model cards
1. Finally, enrich the Tang2020 models with its respective document
2. Re-open the "Compare models" operator
3. Open the drilldown
4. Ensure that when the drill-down starts:
   - The summary regenerates automatically
   - The overview begins to generate
   - The model graphs are displayed
   - Model card information is displayed for all models
6. Clear the goal and click on the "Compare" button. When the overview is generated, it should only compare the metadata information from each model and not look at the structure.
   - It should have a title that states it is comparing all 3 models
   - It should have a summary of the comparison
   - It should compare the structure of ALL the models
   - It should compare the metadata information for ALL the models
7. Add a goal of comparison and click on the compare button
   - The summary should address the goal and make a recommendation

### 6. Working with the Compare models drilldown: NOTEBOOK
1. Switch to the **Notebook** tab.
2. Type "Compare models" into the AI assistant and press the **Send** icon (or enter)
3. It should generate some Python code.
4. Click **Run**
5. It should generate three graphs that compare each model against each other:
   - Bertozzi2020 vs. Fang2020
   - Bertozzi2020 vs. Tang2020
   - Fang2020 vs. Tang2020
